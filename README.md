# CandidateReviewer
Mobile apps for recruiters to view candidates.

Test assignment: 
The Israeli Mossad, due to its special recruitment methods, has access to all developers in the world.  
Their cyber units are rapidly growing, and the recruitment process must be improved to stand their needs.  
The challenge is to filter out and find the best matching candidates for the right position.  
Your task is to craft a Xamarin application, that will make their work more efficient.

### The Mossad recruiter is expecting to be able to:
1. Insert a match criteria - a combination of a technology (from a list) and years of experience (a number)
2. Swipe left or right on a candidate, which will mark him/her as accepted or rejected
3. View a list of all accepted candidates
